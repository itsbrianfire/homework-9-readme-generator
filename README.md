  ## Contributions
  ##### As the developer, I have created an array of questions for the user's input, written a function to write the README file, created function to initialize the app, wrote an init(); call to initialize the app, required 'fs' and 'inquirer' from node, and connected the generateMarkdown using require to run the New ReadMe and call license objects into the New ReadMe.
